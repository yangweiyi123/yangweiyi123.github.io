    I was led to my passions through extensive involvement in multiple research projects on rural urbanisation and poverty alleviation. As the team leader of the undergraduate research group on rural development at my university, I have led several field trips to different underdeveloped counties in Heilongjiang Province to conduct surveys and collect data on rural urbanisation. During these visits, I frequently witnessed firsthand the unintended consequences of ill urbanisation planning. At Tangwang County, I saw empty jungles of concrete standing on wetlands and what would have been farm fields for indigo fruits; the locals, who relied on farming fruits for making a living, continued to live in their unimpressive farm houses because they were taking home smaller incomes due to losing farm land to work on and could not afford to purchase the new apartments. At Lindian County, a touristy place famous for its springs, I saw heavily under-used modern apartment buildings sprawling through the region while the County locals crowded in stifling, old low-rises densely built in concentrated areas, a result of poor estimation of tourist flow and an erroneous, hasty duplication of urbanisation strategies of other tourist cities. <br /> </td>
